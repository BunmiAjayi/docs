## Zoom Video-Conferencing technical support



**Purpose**

This SOP covers the basic activities/tasks that need to be carried out when providing technical hosting support in a BCC Zoom video conference.

There are two types of Zoom video conferences - many to many (typical Zoom video conference) and one/few to many (Webinar type  video conference). The Zoom Webinar product achieves the latter but will not be utilised by BCC for now. 

**Scope**

- Zoom video conferences booked in the events calendar (requiring support) e.g. Monthly Church Prayer Meeting 
- Large attendance expected - 100+ participants
- Official church Zoom account is in use

**Responsibilities**

- Work with the church office to organise the Zoom video conferencing events i.e. using planner in Churchsuite to add relevant detail, work with event owner
- Ensure the meeting credentials are accurate before they are published
- Starting the meeting and assigning co-hosts
- Spotlighting speakers and removing them from spotlight as required
- Muting and un-muting as required
- Screen sharing or enabling participants to share their screens i.e. to play media, PowerPoint etc.
- Admitting participants into the meeting via the waiting room
- Creating and configuring Breakout Rooms as required
- Managing users who join/re-join the meeting during a breakout session
- Renaming users (mainly speakers, event facilitators etc.) for ease of identification 
- Recording the video conference (either to the cloud or locally)
- Removing disruptive participants from the meeting
- Locking the meeting if deemed necessary
